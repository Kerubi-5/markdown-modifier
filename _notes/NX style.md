NX repo styles:

package-based repos:

Very flexible, it is just like having separate repos and publishing it to npm that allows it code shareability so for example if you wanna make a new package, it is basic just like creating a new repo inside the package folder. I think J6 uses this type of nx

pros:
- Add caching and task orchestration without modifying tooling or file structure
- Import existing projects into the repo without modifying their tooling
- Easily create new projects or tools with code generators


Integrated repos:

This one is like typescript to javascript, which enforces strict rules on new packages that we are going to add in this kind of monorepo, but should be easy since all tooling decisions have already been enforced. In summary we have one tooling that will be used to all packages, this is more for large scale applications and large teams so that the repo is not chaotic.

pros:
- Enforce architectural decisions with tagging rules
- Encourage consistency with custom code generators
- Automate updating dependencies of the entire toolchain

Standalone application:

This is only for single application with tooling support of a monorepo

pros:
- Set up a fast CI system without CI expertise
- Easily add new tooling

Notes:

My suggestion would be to move forward with Integrated repositories since I forsee that we are gonna be primarily using React based projects that we plan to support long term and this would allow us streamlined development tooling for all of our projects.

However if our projects are gonna be distinct and would have different toolings based on individual projects I suggest we go with package based repositories like with J6


#### Package-based Repos:

Package-based repositories are highly flexible, resembling the management of separate repositories. This approach facilitates code shareability, allowing for easy addition of new packages as if creating new repositories within the package folder. It's akin to managing independent projects with the added benefits of a Monorepo, such as shared tooling and centralized management.

**Pros**:

- **Add caching and task orchestration** without modifying tooling or file structure, enhancing build efficiency.
- **Import existing projects** into the repo without modifying their tooling, easing integration.
- **Easily create new projects or tools** with code generators, fostering innovation and efficiency.

#### Integrated Repos:

Integrated repositories enforce strict rules and unified tooling across packages, akin to the strict type checking TypeScript provides over JavaScript. This approach is suited for large-scale applications and teams, ensuring consistency and reducing complexity in the development process.

**Pros**:

- **Enforce architectural decisions** with tagging rules, maintaining a clean and organized codebase.
- **Encourage consistency** across projects with custom code generators, streamlining development.
- **Automate updating dependencies** across the entire toolchain, simplifying maintenance.

#### Standalone Application:

This setup is designed for single applications but benefits from monorepo tooling support, offering a focused and streamlined development environment.

**Pros**:

- **Set up a fast CI system** without needing CI expertise, simplifying the deployment process.
- **Easily add new tooling**, keeping the project up-to-date with minimal effort.

### Recommendation:

My suggestion would be for React-based projects intended for long-term support, **integrated repositories** are recommended to ensure streamlined development tooling across all projects. This approach offers a unified environment that simplifies both development and maintenance.

However, if the projects are distinct, with varying tooling needs, **package-based repositories** provide the flexibility required for independent development while still benefiting from shared code and tooling.
