**Dev Workflow****


install nx globally using `npm i -g nx` this will make sure so that we dont have to do `npx nx` but use nx directly.

We also can use **NX console** to add dependencies and also create new packages in an integrated repository, it is an interactive VSCode extension that the nx dev team created so that we dont have to memorize the commands for NX

Our default directory would be `packages` folder in which all our apps would live.



Folder structure proposal

libs folder for all codes related to `utils` , `ui`, or other libs related code

`packages` or maybe `apps?` where all our project/product live, for example the `retail-management-software`
